Juniper is a cross-platform application that listens for special 
messages that you and your close friends send, to push notifications 
to your devices and control them natively in cool ways. Right now, 
Android, iOS, Windows, OSX, and the web are supported, with Linux 
and BlackBerry on the roadmap.

The desktop and mobile applications are written entirely in web 
technologies like Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS, and is built 
on top of the Titanium Desktop framework. For more information on 
Titanium and their mobile and desktop development frameworks, please

Juniper is online at http://juniperapp.com.
